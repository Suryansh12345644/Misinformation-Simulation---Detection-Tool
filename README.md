# Misinformation Simulation & Detection Tool

## Overview
An educational Python-based project designed to simulate the spread of misinformation and analyze basic detection patterns.  
The goal of this project is to study how misleading information propagates and to promote awareness around media literacy and ethical technology use.

## Key Features
- Simulates generation of misleading or incorrect information samples
- Differentiates between verified and unverified content
- Demonstrates basic rule-based detection logic
- Logs and analyzes simulated misinformation patterns

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the main script using:
   python main.py

## Educational Objective
This project focuses on:
- Understanding misinformation dynamics
- Ethical handling of simulated false data
- Awareness of digital media responsibility
- Logical decision-making using code

## Ethical Considerations
This tool does NOT spread real misinformation.
All generated content is simulated and used strictly for educational and research demonstration purposes.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended solely for academic learning and awareness.
It should not be used to generate or distribute real-world misinformation.
